<summary>Simple Aggregates Caught All</summary>

**Given a list of Products, return a single result.**

* Count
* Min Price 
* Max Price
* Average Price
* Total Price (This is assuming that someone bought one of each thing.)
* **We only want to see those products that have are not discontinued**
* **NOTE:  You will need to use the FirstOrDefault()**

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

  ```cs
Products
	.Select(x => new
	{
		Count = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Count(),
		MinPrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Min(x => x.UnitPrice),
		MaxPrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Select(x => x.UnitPrice).Max(),
		AveragePrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Average(x => x.UnitPrice),
		TotalPrice = Products
					.Where(x => x.Discontinued == false)
					.Select(x => x.UnitPrice).Sum()
	}
)
.FirstOrDefault()
.Dump();
 ```

<summary>Count</summary>

**Given a list of Suppliers, return the following information.**

* Supplier Name (shown as Name) 
* Number of Products they supply (shown as ProductCount)

* **Order by Number of Products from largest to smallest, Name**  

  
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

  ```cs
Suppliers
.Select(s => new
{
	Name = s.CompanyName,
	ProductCount = Products
				.Where(p => p.SupplierID == s.SupplierID)
				.Count()
}).OrderByDescending(x => x.ProductCount)
.ThenBy(x => x.Name)
.Dump();
 ```

<summary>Sum - Strongly Type</summary>

**Given a list of Suppliers, return the following information.**

* Supplier Name (shown as Name) 
* History
  * Products sold by the supplier (shown as name)
  * Total quantity sold to customer.  They will used this information to figure out which is the best selling items (shown as QuantitySold)

* **Order by Suppliers then Quantity of items sold from largest to smallest, Name**  

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

  ```cs
void Main()
{
	Suppliers
	.OrderBy(s => s.CompanyName)
	.Select(s => new
	{
		Name = s.CompanyName,
		History = Products
					.Where(p => p.SupplierID == s.SupplierID)
					.Select(p => new HistoryView()
					{
						Name = p.ProductName,
						QuantitySold = OrderDetails
    						.Where(od => od.ProductID == p.ProductID)
    						.Sum(od => od.Quantity)

					}).OrderByDescending(x => x.QuantitySold)
	})
	.Dump();
}

public class HistoryView
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	//  quantity sold must be nullable due to OrderDetails.Quantity being nullable
	public int? QuantitySold { get; set; }
}
 ```

<summary>Count/Max/Min/Average/Sum</summary>

**Given a list of Orders, return the following information.**

* Order ID
* Number of transaction that makes up that order (shown as TransactionCount)
* Largest transaction that that makes up that order [Quantity * UnitPrice]  (shown as MaxExtPrice)
* Smallest transaction that that makes up that order [Quantity * UnitPrice]  (shown as MinExtPrice)
* Average transaction that that makes up that order [Quantity * UnitPrice]  (shown as AvgExtPrice)
* Calculate the Order sub total before discount [Quantity * UnitPrice]  (shown as SubTotal) 
* **Order by Order ID**  

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

  ```cs
Orders
	.Select(o => new
	{
		OrderID = o.OrderID,
		TransactionCount = o.OrderDetails.Count(),
		MaxExtPrice = o.OrderDetails.Max(od => od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice),
		MinExtPrice = o.OrderDetails.Select(od => od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice).Min(),
		AvgExtPrice = o.OrderDetails.Average(od => od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice),
		SubTotal = o.OrderDetails.Select(od => od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice).Sum()
	}).Dump();
 ```
